Berlin, the capital city of Germany, is widely associated with its World War II

Neuschwanstein Castle, the most photographed building in Germany, is also one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations. Constructed in the late 1800s, the Castle was never built for defense purposes, compared to most castles. The castle was actually built as a retreat for King Ludwig II of Bavaria.
