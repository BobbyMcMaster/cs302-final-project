Munich, best known as the origin of the world famous Oktoberfest, is one of the best places to visit in Germany. The center of the city is an appealing blend of classic and modern architecture, historic churches, royal palaces, as well as
high end shopping centers and a bustling nightlife.

## Berlin
Berlin, the capital city of Germany, is widely associated with its World War II
history and division by the Berlin Wall during the Cold War. Since the removal of the wall in 1989, Berlin is now a city full of diverse ethnic groups and culture, as well as sightseeing attractions, and nightlife. Most tourists are drawn to Berlin's famous historic structures, such as the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate.

## Neuschwanstein
Neuschwanstein Castle, the most photographed building in Germany, is also one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations. Constructed in the late 1800s, the Castle was never built for defense purposes, compared to most castles. The castle was actually built as a retreat for King Ludwig II of Bavaria.
